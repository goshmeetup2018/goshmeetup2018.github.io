  topic: Influence of Open Source Hardware and Opportunities
  description: Open source software is not a new topic in world today. It's in such a wide spread state because many people worked really hard to get it there. Next is open source hardware. Software and hardware will look different conceptually; but open concept can be applied the same way. Community is growing towards supporting open source hardware just like it did when open source software emerged. Gathering for Open Science Hardware Conference is a better example to show how like minded developers and engineers from all around the world come together hoping for a better future.
